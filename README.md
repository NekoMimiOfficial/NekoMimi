# The NekoMimi PyModule  
This is my "one size fits all" module that helps you do all sorts of repetative and/or useful but hard to manage tasks  
From checking website uptime to working with data in a registry or manually and dynamically loading modules  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All versions above v1.1.0 wont change or deprecate features no matter the numbers of versions the come  
> However prior to v1.1.0 every release has a breaking change so it's advised not to use them and only stick with v1.3.0+
